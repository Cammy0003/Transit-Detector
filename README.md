## Description:

To create a transit detecting prototype program, that parses and analyzes 
TESS light curve data from various stars. This program is designed primarily in Rust,
to ensure high performance speeds, and tight control over statistical operations. 

In being a prototype, many more complex operations, such as spline detrending, are omitted,
but it is expected that the program will at least detect more obvious transits.

## How to Run:

## Development Procedure

Refer to `notes/Plan.md` (by Chat GPT) and `notes/PlanExplanation.md` (by Gemini), for the general recipe 
that I intend to follow with this project.

## Current Progress
Status: **Completed `v1.0` on Nov-18-2025**

Refer to `notes/Progress.md` for the progress made on the project.

## References

The LightCurve data that this project used while in development was from The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite 
(TESS). 

Chat GPT and Gemini helped with a bunch of things, as usual. Praise be to the AI overlords!!

## Version:

1. `v1.0` completed Nov-18-2025:
   Although technically completed for the baseline goal, the code still needs to be seriously organized and tested 
   in depth, before it can be used seriously. The plan is to do such for `v2.0`.
